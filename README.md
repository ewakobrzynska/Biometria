Fingerprint Feature Extraction - Level II Characteristics
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of algorithms for detecting fingerprint features, specifically focusing on Level II characteristics such as terminations (endings) and bifurcations (branchings) of fingerprint ridge lines. These features are crucial for biometric identification systems.

Dataset
The fingerprint images are sourced from the SOCOFing dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded directly using the provided script.

Installation
To set up the environment and download the necessary dataset, follow these steps:
