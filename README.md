## üßê Overview

Fingerprint analysis is crucial in various security and identification applications. This project aims to:

- Detect and visualize fingerprint ridge endings and bifurcations.
- Provide a robust algorithm for extracting secondary fingerprint features.
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using the SOCOFing dataset.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Apply Gaussian and median blurs for noise reduction.
- **Histogram Analysis:** Analyze image histograms to determine optimal thresholds.
- **Adaptive Binarization:** Convert images to binary for further processing.
- **Skeletonization:** Reduce the image to its skeletal form for easier feature extraction.
- **Feature Detection:** Identify and highlight ridge endings and bifurcations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ewakobrzynska/biometria.git
cd fingerprint-feature-extraction
